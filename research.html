      <h2>Tropical Cyclone Structure and Intensity</h2>
        <div class="image" style="max-width:400px"><img width="100%" alt="Tropical Cyclone" src="img/Tropical_Cyclone.png"/> </div>
        <p>Tropical cyclones (TCs) are one of the most devastating disasters for coastal areas. The damages from a landfalling TC mainly come from strong winds, heavy rainfall and storm surges, which are highly related to TC's intensity and structure. Studies have been exploring both the internal and external factors influencing the intensity and structure. However, a clear quantitative analysis with physical understanding to connect the intensity and structure together is still missing.</p>
<br>

        <div class="image" style="max-width:400px"><img width="100%" alt="Tropical cyclone Structure and Intensity" src="img/Tropical_Cyclone_Intensity_Structure.png"/> </div> <br>
        <p>The related characteristics of TCs include intensity, size, radial profile of tangential winds and intensification rate. Previous studies explored the connection among them mostly from statistical analysis and model simulations. My approach is slightly different that I use TC theories as guidance to find the relationship among these dynamically related parameters.</p>
        <p>The various tropical cyclone axisymmetric theories, developed based on the three basic assumptions of gradient wind balance, hydrostatic balance and slantwise moist neutrality, are suitable for exploring TCs during the rapid intensification and steady state stages. Though there are discrepancies between theories and real TCs, it is also interesting to see how much the theories can explain the results from observations and model simulations.</p>
      <br>  
      <h2>Dynamics and Predictability of Tropical Cyclones under Different Environmental Conditions</h2>
        <p>The prerequisite for the axisymmetric tropical cyclone theory limits its application on early stage/weak TCs, which are usually asymmetric and have loosely organized convections. It has been shown that weak tropical cyclones are vulnerable to the hostile environment (e.g., vertical wind shear), which can lower the predictability of tropical cyclogenesis and rapid intensification onset.</p>

        <p>The figure on the left (adapted from <a href="paper/TaoZhang2015JAMES.pdf">Tao and Zhang 2015</a>) exhibits the extremely large uncertainty in RI onset times given the modest uncertainty in environmental vertical wind shear (5 - 7.5 m/s) and the unnoticeble initial moisture perturbations in the boundary layer, which presents the challenges associated with both the practical and intrinsic predictabilities of tropical cyclones. This large spread in RI onset times is attributed to the moist convection, of which the chaotic nature introduces the small-scale errors at first and gradually influences the storm-scale circulations. </p>

        <p>As indicated in the schematic diagrams on the left, the upscale error growth from small differences in the moist convection alters the storm structure, which in turn changes the distribution and strength of the moist convections. Other environmental factors, like environmental moisture and sea surface temperature, can also affect the predictability of TCs through further modifying the moist convections. Generally speaking, higher sea surface temperature and moister environment are conducive to the TC development. The resilience of TCs in the hostile environment should be considered with all factors.</p>
